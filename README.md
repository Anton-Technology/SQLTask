# SQLTask
Task to create a database with PostgreSQL that keeps tracks of courses, course instances, employees, assigned courses and hours and similar things. All the data for this is machine-generated and is not relevant to anything other than seeing that the database works.

This repository contains a university project that I Anton Carlsson produced by myself in PostgreSQL.
I Anton Carlsson own the rights to the code in these files and publish it here after I have received a passing grade in this part of the course as a part of my E-portfolio.

To check that this work you should run Databasestructure query first, then the Example generated Data query and last there are 4 possible queries in example queries that can be just to test different requests to the data stored from the 2 previous files.
